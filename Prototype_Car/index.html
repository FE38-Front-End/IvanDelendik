    <h1>Task</h1>
    <pre>
      • implement inheritance in ES5 way
      Use ES5 syntax
       • create a file inheritance-es5.js
       • create a class Car : this function should accept 7 params:
       ◦ name
       ◦ model
       ◦ year
       ◦ color
       ◦ maxSpeed
       ◦ fuelCapacity - optional parameter, use 60 by default
       ◦ fuelConsumption - optional parameter, use 10 by default
       • implement a common car method getFullName, which should return a full name (e.x. name + model)
       • implement a common car method getAge, which should return your car age (current year - your car year)
       • implement a common car method changeColor, which should do:
       ◦ take a parameter (color);
       ◦ if your car already has the same color, show a message with text (up to you);
       ◦ if not, change the color and show a message about it.
       • implement a common car method calculateWay, which should do:
       ◦ take 2 params: kilometers and fuel;
       ◦ check if fuel < 10, show a message about refuel;
       ◦ calculate the time that you need to reach the destination, show message about it;
       ◦ check, if you need to refuel on your road and show a message (how many times you need to refuel)
       • create 3 another class, which should inherit from Car class in ES5 way (e.x. BMW, Lexus, etc. <— up to you)
       • create class properties, which should refers only to that particular car factory, and should not effect others( for example all BMW’s would have sunroof, all Lexus’s would have climateControl and so on (all properties is up to you) )
       • create methods, which should refers only to that particular car factory, and should not effect others
       • create at least one instance of each class
       • check your solution in browser console (include your js file in any html)
      implement inheritance in ES6 way (use the class keyword)
      Use ES6 syntax only (let, const, arrow functions and so on)
       • create a file inheritance-es6.js
       • do the same steps as in ES5 mode, but in ES6 syntax (use the extends and super keywords for inheritance)
